    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joe, and my journey into web development started in a fun and unexpected wayâ€”customizing my MySpace profile! What began as a simple interest in making my page stand out soon turned into a passion for coding and building technology.</p>

    <h3>How It All Started</h3>
    <p>My first hands-on experience with web development was editing my MySpace profile. I enjoyed learning bits of HTML to add personality to my page. However, I didnâ€™t fully dive into programming until I took a Java course in college. From there, my curiosity grew, and I began exploring different programming languages and web technologies.</p>
